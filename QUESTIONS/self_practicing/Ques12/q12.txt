Write a program to find the Nth Fibonacci number using loops.

Note :
The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with first_number  and Second_number . 
First_number and Second_number in this question will be 1 . Soo that the resultant series will be 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 ...
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10000     
Where ‘N’ represents the number for which we have to find its equivalent Fibonacci number.

Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1:
6
Sample Output 1:
8
Explanation
The Fibonacci sequence starts with two numbers first number is 1 and second number is also 1.
 The subsequent numbers are found by adding the two preceding numbers. Therefore, the first six Fibonacci numbers are: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 . Hence, the 6th Fibonacci number is 8.
