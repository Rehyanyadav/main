POINTERS

It is symbolic representation of address.
They enable programs to simulate call by refrence as 
well as to create and manipulate dynamic data structures

Syntax:- 

datatype *var_name;
int *ptr; //ptr can point to an address which hold int data 



int var = 10;
int *ptr =&var;
*ptr = 20;
int **ptr = &ptr;
**ptr = 30;


example code 


#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
using namespace std; 
void geeks() 
{ 
    int var = 20; 
  
    // declare pointer variable 
    int* ptr; 
  
    // note that data type of ptr and var must be same 
    ptr = &var; 
  
    // assign the address of a variable to a pointer 
    cout << "Value at ptr = " << ptr << "\n"; 
    cout << "Value at var = " << var << "\n"; 
    cout << "Value at *ptr = " << *ptr << "\n"; 
} 
// Driver program 
int main()  
{  
  geeks();  
  return 0; 
}
