Q) Find the second largest element in an array 


1) bruteforce solution
sort the array in ascending order and then 
The element present at the second index is the second smallest element
The element present at the second index from the end is the second largest element



2) better solution
find the smallest and largest element in the array in  single traversal.

After this , we once again traversal the array and find and element
that is just greater than the smallest element we just found.

We find the largest element is just smaller than the largest element 
we just found.


3) Optimal Approach 

If the current element is smaller than ‘small’, then we update second_small and small variables
Else if the current element is smaller than ‘second_small’ then we update the variable ‘second_small’
Once we traverse the entire array, we would find the second smallest element in the variable second_small.
Here’s a quick demonstration of the same.
Second Largest Algo:

If the current element is larger than ‘large’ then update second_large and large variables
Else if the current element is larger than ‘second_large’ then we update the variable second_large.
Once we traverse the entire array, we would find the second largest element in the variable second_large.
