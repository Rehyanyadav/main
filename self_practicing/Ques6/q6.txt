Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. 
The user has to enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character),
 depending upon which the total salary is calculated as:
    Total_salary = Basic + HRA + DA + Allow – PF
where :
HRA   = 20% of basic
DA    = 50% of basic
Allow = 1700 if grade = ‘A’
Allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’
Allow = 1300 if grade = ‘C' or any other character
PF    = 11% of basic.
Round off the total salary and then print the integral part only.

Note for C++ users :
To round off the value, please include<cmath> library at the start of the program and round off the values in this way.
int ans = round(yourFinalValue);
