/*
*INDEXING OF CHARACTER IN STRING*

indexing of character in string
 is similar to the arrays 
 it starts from 
 0 1 2 3 4 5........ n-1  (NULL character at last)


*ASCII values*

characters has a numeric values 

a- z   -> 97 - 122
A-Z    -> 65 - 90
*/



/*
*STRING vs CHARACTER array

String -> 1) string is a class 
          2) string variables are objects of this class
          3) String Str_value; we don't need to predefined it 
          4) String have dynamic memory allocations it leads to avoid loss of memory 
          5) no pre-located 
          6) Have inbuilt functions

char array -> 1) Array of char data types
              2) char array_name[size]; we need to predefined the array 
              3) static memory allocations
              4) Unused allocated memory is wasted 
              5) faster than string
