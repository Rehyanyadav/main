Perfect 👍 You’re starting with **Arrays & Strings**, which is the backbone of DSA prep. I’ll build you a **concept → practice path (basic → advanced)** with algorithms, intuition, and problem progression.

# 🔹 Arrays & Strings (Foundation → Advanced Roadmap)

## 1. Basics of Arrays & Strings

📌 Concepts:

* Indexing, Traversal, In-place Updates
* Reversal, Rotation, Prefix/Suffix arrays
* Basic String operations

✅ Problems:

* **GFG**: Leaders in an array, Equilibrium Point
* **LC Easy**: Two Sum, Rotate Array
* **LC Easy**: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

👉 *Idea:* Build intuition on traversals and prefix/suffix handling.

---

## 2. Prefix Sum & Difference Arrays

📌 Concepts:

* Prefix sum array
* Prefix XOR
* Difference arrays (range updates)

✅ Problems:

* **LC**: Subarray Sum Equals K
* **LC**: Range Sum Query - Immutable (Prefix Sum)
* **LC**: Continuous Subarray Sum (Prefix + Hashing)
* **GFG**: Prefix Sum and Equilibrium Point

👉 *Idea:* Learn how pre-computation converts O(N²) → O(N).

---

## 3. Two Pointers Technique

📌 Concepts:

* Opposite direction (sorted arrays, e.g., sum problems)
* Same direction (sliding across window)
* Avoiding nested loops with two pointers

✅ Problems:

* **LC**: Two Sum II (Sorted)
* **LC**: 3Sum / 4Sum (medium → hard)
* **LC**: Container With Most Water ⭐
* **LC**: Valid Palindrome
* **LC**: Move Zeroes

👉 *Idea:* Shrinking / expanding window, optimal O(N) search.

---

## 4. Sliding Window (Fixed & Variable Length)

📌 Concepts:

* Fixed-size windows (sum/average problems)
* Variable-size windows (longest/shortest subarray problems)

✅ Problems:

* **LC**: Maximum Average Subarray I (Fixed)
* **LC**: Minimum Size Subarray Sum
* **LC**: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters ⭐
* **LC**: Longest Repeating Character Replacement

👉 *Idea:* Efficient substring/subarray handling without brute force.

---

## 5. Kadane’s Algorithm & Variants

📌 Concepts:

* Max Subarray Sum (basic Kadane)
* Circular arrays (Kadane + Min subarray sum)
* DP extension (max product subarray, max sum with one deletion)

✅ Problems:

* **LC**: Maximum Subarray
* **LC**: Maximum Sum Circular Subarray
* **LC**: Maximum Product Subarray
* **GFG**: Kadane’s Algorithm

👉 *Idea:* DP optimization in O(N) for sum/product problems.

---

## 6. Sorting & Binary Search on Arrays

📌 Concepts:

* Merge Intervals (sorting-based greedy)
* Binary Search on Answer (like peak element, min capacity)
* Lower/Upper bounds for searching in ranges

✅ Problems:

* **LC**: Merge Intervals
* **LC**: Search in Rotated Sorted Array
* **LC**: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
* **LC**: Median of Two Sorted Arrays ⭐⭐
* **LC**: Kth Largest Element in Array

👉 *Idea:* Extend sorting to interval problems, binary search to decision problems.

## 7. Advanced Array/Matrix Concepts

📌 Concepts:

* Trapping Rain Water (prefix/suffix, 2-pointer)
* Matrix problems (rotate, transpose, search in 2D sorted matrix)
* Hashing + Arrays combo (frequency-based problems)

✅ Problems:

* **LC**: Trapping Rain Water ⭐
* **LC**: Rotate Image (Matrix)
* **LC**: Set Matrix Zeroes
* **LC**: Spiral Matrix
* **LC**: Subarray Sum Equals K (Hash + Prefix)

# 🚀 How to Advance in These Topics

1. **Step 1 – Learn the Pattern**
   Don’t just memorize solutions, understand *why* Prefix Sum / Sliding Window works.

2. **Step 2 – Group Problems by Pattern**
   Example:

   * Prefix Sum problems → batch practice (Subarray Sum, Equilibrium, Continuous Subarray Sum).
   * Sliding Window problems → batch practice (Longest Substring, Min Size Subarray, Max Avg Subarray).

3. **Step 3 – Move from Easy → Hard**
   Start with GFG/Easy LC → Medium → Hard (3Sum, Rain Water, Median of Two Sorted Arrays).

4. **Step 4 – Revisit & Generalize**
   After solving, ask: *Can I apply this template elsewhere?*
   Example: Kadane → Max Product Subarray → Circular Array → Dynamic Variants.

👉 If you want, I can also **make you a topic-wise problem sheet (with direct links)**:

* Prefix Sum set
* Two Pointers set
* Sliding Window set
* Kadane variants set

Do you want me to prepare that **problem sheet with links (LC + GFG)** so you can follow step by step?
